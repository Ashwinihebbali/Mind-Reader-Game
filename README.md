🔮 Mind Reader – Optical Illusion Game

“I can read your mind… with just math and a little magic.”
A fun and mystical optical illusion game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project creates the illusion that it can guess the symbol you're thinking of — but the trick lies in clever math and visual storytelling.

🧠 The Illusion
The game relies on a math trick:  
Any 2-digit number minus the sum of its digits will always result in a **multiple of 9**.  
The same symbol is secretly assigned to all multiples of 9 — creating the illusion of "mind reading".
